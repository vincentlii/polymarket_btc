# Vendor Fetch Sources And Timing

Timing output is enabled by default for public runners that use
`@timing_harness`. Set `BACKTEST_ENABLE_TIMING=0` only when you explicitly want
quiet output.

## PMXT

PMXT book runners fetch historical L2 order-book data one UTC hour at a time.
The hour lookup order is:

1. Local filtered cache.
2. Each explicit raw source in `MarketDataConfig.sources`, left to right.
3. Confirmed miss.

The public PMXT runners usually use:

```python
sources=(
    "local:/Volumes/storage/pmxt_data",
    "archive:r2v2.pmxt.dev",
    "archive:r2.pmxt.dev",
)
```

After a successful raw-source fetch, the market/token/hour slice is written to
the filtered cache under `~/.cache/nautilus_trader/pmxt`. Warm filtered-cache
reads should be sub-millisecond to low-millisecond per hour because the cache
stores a compact filtered parquet slice rather than the full raw archive hour.

When multiple PMXT replays load together, the adapter stages all metadata
first, then all book data, then all execution trade ticks. Filtered-cache
misses are grouped by raw archive hour: one local or remote raw parquet hour can
serve many market/token requests before the per-replay filtered caches are
written.

## Example Output

A representative PMXT run prints:

```text
PMXT source: explicit priority (cache -> local /Volumes/storage/pmxt_data -> archive https://r2v2.pmxt.dev -> archive https://r2.pmxt.dev)
Loading PMXT Polymarket market will-ludvig-aberg-win-the-2026-masters-tournament (token_index=0, window_start=2026-04-05T00:00:00+00:00, window_end=2026-04-07T23:59:59+00:00)...
  2026-04-05T00:00:00+00:00      ...          ... rows  cache polymarket_orderbook_2026-04-05T00.parquet
  2026-04-06T12:00:00+00:00      ...          ... rows  local raw
  2026-04-07T23:00:00+00:00      ...            0 rows  none
PMXT book progress [#######################-] 69.0/72 hours (95.8%; started=72, done=69, active=3)
```

Important fields:

- `PMXT source:` shows exact source priority.
- `cache` means the filtered market/token/hour cache satisfied the request.
- `local raw` means a local raw archive hour was scanned and filtered.
- `r2 raw` means a remote raw archive hour was downloaded and filtered.
- `none` means the hour was not found in any configured source.
- Active progress shows currently running scans or transfers.

## Telonex

Telonex book runners read full-depth daily book snapshots from
`book_snapshot_full`.

Typical source config:

```python
MarketDataConfig(
    platform=Polymarket,
    data_type=Book,
    vendor=Telonex,
    sources=(
        "api:",
        "local:/Volumes/storage/telonex_data",
    ),
)
```

The effective lookup order for converted replay records is:

1. Telonex materialized replay caches under `book-deltas-v2` and
   `trade-ticks-v1`.
2. Explicit entries in `MarketDataConfig.sources`, left to right.
3. For execution trade ticks only, Polymarket's public trades cache/API remains
   the final fallback after Telonex local/API misses.

The `Telonex source:` line shows that implicit cache layer:

```text
Telonex book source: explicit priority (cache -> api https://api.telonex.io (key set) -> local /Volumes/storage/telonex_data)
Telonex trade source: explicit priority (cache -> api https://api.telonex.io (key set) -> local /Volumes/storage/telonex_data -> polymarket cache -> api https://data-api.polymarket.com/trades)
```

Local reads use the DuckDB manifest when present. The manifest maps requested
market/outcome/channel/day ranges to concrete parquet part paths, so the loader
does not need to glob or scan unrelated partitions. If a candidate local part is
empty or unreadable, it is ignored and the loader can fall through to the next
source.

API reads are daily. A first API run writes both the raw nested daily parquet
and a `.fast.parquet` sidecar. Warm cache reads prefer the sidecar, which
stores `bid_prices`, `bid_sizes`, `ask_prices`, and `ask_sizes` as
`list<string>` columns. That keeps price/size precision and avoids slow nested
list-of-struct pandas decoding.

After any raw/cache/local/API day is converted to `OrderBookDeltas`, the loader
writes a materialized replay parquet. Non-empty Telonex `onchain_fills` or
`trades` days are also materialized as `TradeTick`s. Empty Telonex onchain-fill
results are not terminal for execution matching; the loader continues to
Telonex `trades` and then Polymarket's public trade fallback before deciding a
day has no trade ticks. Repeated runs for the same market, token, instrument id,
day, and clipped window report `telonex deltas cache ...` or
`telonex onchain_fills cache ...` / `telonex trades cache ...` and skip
local/API decoding. Local/API trade-tick labels also include the exact Telonex
channel, such as `telonex local onchain_fills` or `telonex local trades`.

Multi-replay Telonex loading uses staged source preparation with bounded
materialization: all Polymarket Gamma/CLOB metadata is prepared first, source
fetch/cache work fans out, then book materialization, trade loading, and replay
building run through a smaller memory cap. `BACKTEST_REPLAY_LOAD_WORKERS`
controls source-stage concurrency, defaults to `32`, and can be raised to `128`;
`BACKTEST_REPLAY_MATERIALIZE_WORKERS` controls the memory-heavy replay object
stage and defaults to `4`. Telonex API requests are separately capped by
`TELONEX_API_WORKERS` and default to `32`; local file, DuckDB, and parquet
operations are capped by `TELONEX_FILE_WORKERS` and default to `28` to avoid
file-descriptor pressure on large 100-market loads.

## Timing Expectations By Source

| Source | Expected behavior | When it happens |
|---|---|---|
| PMXT filtered cache | Fastest PMXT path; compact filtered parquet per market/token/hour | Second run onward for the same market, token, and hour |
| Local PMXT raw archive | Local disk bound; grouped by raw hour during batch loads | Hour is missing from filtered cache but exists in `local:/...` |
| Remote PMXT raw archive | Network and full-hour parquet bound; grouped by raw hour during batch loads | Hour is missing locally and archive fallback is configured |
| Telonex deltas cache | Fastest Telonex path; materialized Nautilus `OrderBookDeltas` | Same market/token/day/window was already converted once |
| Telonex materialized trade-tick cache | Fastest Telonex execution path; materialized Nautilus `TradeTick`s | Same market/token/day/window Telonex fills or trades were already converted once |
| Telonex fast API cache | Local disk bound; avoids nested payload materialization | API day was previously downloaded and sidecar exists or was lazily migrated |
| Local Telonex mirror | Local disk bound; manifest-pruned parquet parts | `/Volumes/storage/telonex_data` has the requested full-book day |
| Telonex API | Network and daily parquet bound | Cache/local mirror misses and `TELONEX_API_KEY` is available |
| None | Fast miss | Hour/day does not exist in any source |

## How To See This Output

Run any public PMXT or Telonex runner directly:

```bash
uv run python backtests/polymarket_book_ema_crossover.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_book_joint_portfolio_runner.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_telonex_book_joint_portfolio_runner.py
```

Run all public Python backtests:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_all_backtests.py
```

Use the timing harness helper when you want only source/timing diagnostics for a
runner:

```bash
uv run python prediction_market_extensions/backtesting/_timing_test.py backtests/polymarket_book_ema_crossover.py
```

Timing output is additive to Nautilus logs. It should remain enabled by default
so local/cache/archive/API source behavior is visible in normal runs.
